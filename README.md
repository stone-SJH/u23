### TODO List:

- [ ] Support SkinnedMeshRenderer
- [ ] Support multiple material applied to one submesh
- [ ] Support exporting customized shader in Unity
- [ ] Support exporting bones


### Problems:

- [ ] Threejs is based on a metallic/roughness pbr work flow, so we need to add new workflows or let user specify a certain workflow to use before they upload their models
- [ ] Volumetric lighting, Particle systems and other systems which are not supported by threejs officially
